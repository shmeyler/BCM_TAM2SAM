The AI engineer's work spanned from stabilizing an existing MVP to significantly enhancing its functionality, user experience, and security. Initially, core services were brought online by resolving missing Python dependencies and environment variable configurations. A major technical pivot involved replacing the OpenAI LLM integration with Together AI's Kimi K2 Instruct 0905 model, which required careful adaptation of API calls and token management. UI/UX was improved by redesigning the analysis progress modal and export buttons. Crucially, a professional PDF export matching the web's segmentation layout, with clickable data sources, was developed. A significant portion of the work focused on implementing robust Google OAuth authentication for specific email domains, including a MongoDB-backed admin panel, which necessitated extensive debugging due to subtle integration issues like URL fragment parsing and rapid session expiry. Finally, custom domain support for authentication was added. The current task involves expanding the analysis capabilities with perspective-based views and firmographic segmentation, starting with backend model adjustments.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a Market Map Generator application with enhanced functionality and a secure user experience. Key requirements include:
1.  **Core Functionality:** Market analysis, TAM-SAM-SOM charts, company logo display, responsive design, curated market database.
2.  **LLM Integration Upgrade:** Replace OpenAI with Together AI's Kimi K2 Instruct 0905 model for market analysis.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements:** Redesign the analysis progress modal to be prominent and full-page, and make the Cancel button intuitive.
4.  **Reporting & Export:**
    *   Ensure comprehensive Executive Summary generation by the LLM.
    *   Implement professional PDF export (BCM-branded, clear sections, matching web layout, with proper text wrapping).
    *   Provide Excel data export.
    *   Make all referenced data sources hotlinked and clickable in both the UI and exported reports.
5.  **Authentication & User Management:**
    *   Implement Google OAuth, restricting access to  email addresses.
    *   Develop an Admin Panel for viewing, activating/deactivating, promoting, deleting, and inviting users, with user data stored in MongoDB.
    *   Secure application routes, requiring authentication for market analysis.
6.  **Deployment & Domain:** Ensure the application is deployment-ready and functions correctly with custom domains (e.g., ).
7.  **Advanced Analysis:**
    *   Introduce Perspective-based Analysis: Reports should be from the point of view of a specific company (if provided) or a new entrant (if no company is provided).
    *   Add Firmographic Segmentation as a breakout for B2B analysis.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of implementing two new features related to the market analysis:
1.  **Perspective-based Analysis:** The user requested that the analysis report should dynamically adjust its viewpoint based on whether a product/service name is provided (existing company perspective) or not (new entrant perspective).
2.  **Firmographic Segmentation:** For B2B analysis, the user wants to add Firmographic Segmentation as a new category of market breakout.

The last action recorded was  of , which shows the  and  Pydantic models. This indicates that the AI engineer was examining the existing data structures in the backend to determine how to best integrate the new analysis perspectives and segmentation types into the application's data flow and the Kimi LLM prompt. The work is currently at the stage of planning the necessary backend model and prompt modifications.

<optional_next_step>
Define new Pydantic models or modify existing ones in  to support Firmographic Segmentation and adjust the Kimi K2 prompt for perspective-based analysis.
