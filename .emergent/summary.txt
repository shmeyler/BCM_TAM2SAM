<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory involved enhancing a Market Map Generator application through several iterations. Initially, the focus was on resolving frontend  import errors and validating backend APIs. Subsequent work addressed user requests for detailed segmentation for persona development (Resonate rAI integration), including Pydantic model updates, LLM prompt engineering, and a new export endpoint. Critical backend issues were tackled, such as JSON parsing errors from the LLM, leading to the implementation of sanitization, and Pydantic validation bottlenecks causing analysis to hang. The engineer also refined the analysis perspective, enhanced the executive summary, and shifted the overall report focus to marketing/advertising. A significant effort was dedicated to upgrading the iconography and logo system, replacing generic elements with professional alternatives and integrating Clearbit. Finally, SpyFu API integration for PPC competitive intelligence was attempted, which ran into API endpoint and authentication issues, leading to the use of mock data. The latest work involved fixing remaining generic icons, restoring strategic analysis content, formatting Google Ads, and addressing the user's report that these changes were not visible.

<product_requirements>
The Market Map Generator application aims to provide robust market analysis with a secure user experience. Core functionality includes market analysis, TAM-SAM-SOM charts, company logos, responsive design, and a curated market database. The LLM integration was upgraded to Together AI's Kimi K2 Instruct 0905. UI/UX was improved with a redesigned analysis progress modal and Cancel button. Reporting features include a comprehensive Executive Summary, professional PDF export, Excel data export, and clickable data sources. Authentication is managed via Google OAuth, restricted to  emails, with an Admin Panel for user management. Deployment supports custom domains. Advanced analysis features include perspective-based analysis (company POV or new entrant) and firmographic segmentation (Industry, Company Size, Location, Title, Role, Company Revenue). UI layout was refined by moving the TAM-SAM-SOM chart and Resources/Footnotes. Aesthetics improvements included correcting TAM-SAM-SOM arrow positioning and professional iconography (replacing static icons/emojis with dynamic , Clearbit logos, Heroicons, Lucide Icons). Recent enhancements focused on detailed, Resonate rAI-mappable segmentation for persona development and PPC competitive intelligence via SpyFu API, along with a marketing-centric analysis perspective.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate why the most recent changes (professional icons, strategic analysis, Google Ads format, PPC data) are not showing up for the user when running an analysis (e.g., fitness tracker).
- Resolve the full SpyFu API integration to use real data instead of mock data, specifically addressing  and  requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had implemented several crucial fixes and enhancements:
1.  **Professional Icons:** Replaced all remaining ChatGPT-style emojis throughout the frontend with professional Heroicons (e.g., , , ).
2.  **Strategic Analysis Restoration:** Corrected a field name mismatch in  where the LLM generated , etc., but the frontend () expected , etc., ensuring strategic sections display populated data.
3.  **Google Ads Formatting:** Redesigned the display of ad examples in  to visually resemble real Google search results with authentic styling.
4.  **PPC Intelligence Integration:** Refined the SpyFu integration (currently using mock data) by correcting API endpoints and authentication flow.

These changes were applied, and both backend and frontend services were restarted. However, the user reported that these updates were not visible when running a fitness tracker analysis on the live site. The AI engineer is currently investigating why these latest changes are not reflected in the user's view, despite logs indicating successful analysis completion and PPC demo data generation.
