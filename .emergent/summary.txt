<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic application template into a comprehensive, AI-powered Market Map Generator with BCM branding. Initial work involved deploying the GitHub repository, configuring OpenAI integration (which required several debugging cycles to get working correctly), and resolving Git-related security errors by properly ignoring the  file. Subsequent efforts focused on refining the application based on user feedback, including significant UI/UX improvements (loading states, button styling, logo display) and core analytical enhancements. Key analytical improvements involved redesigning market segmentation to a 4-category framework, ensuring a minimum number of competitors, making strategic recommendations more actionable, and generating a professional executive summary. The AI also implemented and refined a TAM→SAM→SOM visual chart. The most recent challenges revolve around the precise positioning of the TAM chart and improving the uniqueness and accuracy of AI-generated market analysis, which the engineer was actively addressing when the summary was requested.

<product_requirements>
The user required an Market Map Generator application to evolve from a basic template to an enterprise-grade, AI-powered tool. The core problem was to generate comprehensive market insights, including market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), segmentation, competitive analysis, and strategic recommendations.

Key requirements and implemented features include:
*   **Dynamic AI Analysis**: Transition from curated data to OpenAI GPT-4 for market intelligence, ensuring unique, industry-specific insights.
*   **Visualizations**: Implement a professional TAM→SAM→SOM concentric circles chart with accurate, detailed, and analytical labels, and precise positioning.
*   **Market Segmentation**: Adopt a 4-category breakdown (Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, Behavioral) with granular detail.
*   **Competitive Benchmarking**: Ensure at least 3-4 real companies are identified, including logos, with detailed analysis.
*   **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide specific, measurable strategic recommendations.
*   **Executive Reporting**: Generate a concise, strategic, AI-powered Executive Summary at the top of results, including real links for data sources.
*   **UI/UX**: Refine loading UI, implement official BCM branding (logo without a white circle), and optimize performance to prevent timeouts.
*   **Technical Stability**: Ensure robust API integration, proper service operation, and secure Git configuration.

<pending_tasks>
-   Refine AI analysis uniqueness: The AI is currently generating generic responses across different markets.
-   Move TAM→SAM→SOM Chart: Ensure its final position is directly underneath the Executive Summary and before the market breakdown into segments.
-   Enhance Research Quality: Investigate leveraging Deep Research (web search) for more accurate, real-time market data.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on addressing two user-identified critical issues with the Market Map Generator:

1.  **TAM→SAM→SOM Chart Positioning**: Despite previous attempts, the chart is not consistently appearing in the desired location (underneath the Executive Summary and before market segmentation). The previous AI engineer encountered issues with the file edit during this re-positioning, specifically with the  tool failing due to scope or edit size in . The last action was to acknowledge this persistent issue and prioritize its fix.

2.  **AI Analysis Uniqueness and Accuracy**: The user reported that the AI-generated analysis (segmentation, market size, growth rate, recommendations) is too generic and similar across different market categories, indicating a need for more unique, industry-specific insights. This implies a refinement of the OpenAI prompts within the  is required to force more differentiated outputs. The AI engineer initiated work on this, including attempting to make the executive summary more concise, but noted potential issues with OpenAI's JSON output parsing, which might be contributing to the generic fallbacks.

The application is currently functional with BCM branding, an Executive Summary, and the TAM chart, but the precise layout and the quality of the AI's analysis for diverse inputs are the primary concerns.
